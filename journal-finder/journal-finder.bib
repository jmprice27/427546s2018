Abstract = {Shape interpolation has many applications in computer graphics such as morphing for computer animation. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven mesh interpolation method. We adapt patch-based linear rotational invariant coordinates to effectively represent deformations of models in a shape collection, and utilize this information to guide the synthesis of interpolated shapes. Unlike previous data-driven approaches, we use a rotation/translation invariant representation which defines the plausible deformations in a global continuous space. By effectively exploiting the knowledge in the shape space, our method produces realistic interpolation results at interactive rates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for challenging cases. We further propose a novel approach to interactive editing of shape morphing according to the shape distribution. The user can explore the morphing path and select example models intuitively and adjust the path with simple interactions to edit the morp},

Abstract = {We present a review of recent techniques for performing geometric analysis in cultural heritage (CH) applications. The survey is aimed at researchers in the areas of computer graphics, computer vision and CH computing, as well as to scholars and practitioners in the CH field. The problems considered include shape perception enhancement, restoration and preservation support, monitoring over time, object interpretation and collection analysis. All of these problems typically rely on an understanding of the structure of the shapes in question at both a local and global level. In this survey, we discuss the different problem forms and review the main solution methods, aided by classification criteria based on the geometric scale at which the analysis is performed and the cardinality of the relationships among object parts exploited during the analysis. We finalize the report by discussing open problems and future perspectives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract="In many creative industries, such as the animation, movie, and game industries, artists often make good use of motion data to create their works by retrieving a particular motion from motion-capture data and reusing it. A large database of human motion is difficult to use unless the motion data are organized according to the type of motion. Although there have been many results for clustering motion capture data, many variations in the motion data complicate the clustering of data by making one type of motion numerically similar to other types of motions. To improve the motion clustering performance, we present a novel physically based motion normalization method that reduces ambiguous elements of motions, so that motions that have different semantics can be differentiated. The normalized motion data generated by our method can be used as input to existing clustering algorithms and improves the results.",

abstract="A variety of approaches have been proposed for polygon mesh reconstruction from a set of unstructured sample points. Suffering from severe aliases at sharp features and having a large number of unnecessary faces, most resulting meshes need to be optimized using input sample points in a postprocess. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to reconstruct high-quality meshes from sample data. The core of our proposed algorithm is a new mesh evaluation criterion which takes full advantage of the relation between the sample points and the reconstructed mesh. Based on our proposed evaluation criterion, we develop necessary operations to efficiently incorporate the functions of data preprocessing, isosurface polygonization, mesh optimization and mesh simplification into one simple algorithm, which can generate high-quality meshes from unstructured point clouds with time and space efficiency.",
